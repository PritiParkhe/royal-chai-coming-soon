# Royal Chai — Coming Soon Landing Page

## 📌 Project Overview

Royal Chai is a premium instant chai brand inspired by royal Indian households.  
This project is a responsive “Coming Soon” landing page designed to establish brand identity, communicate heritage, and capture early user interest before launch.

The landing page focuses on a royal, elegant visual language with warm tones and a single clear call-to-action.

This project was built as a **Frontend Development Assignment** to demonstrate UI/UX design sense, responsive layout, and clean React code.
